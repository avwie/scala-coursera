/**
  * This component implements a parser to define terrains from a
  * graphical ASCII representation.
  *
  * When mixing in that component, a level can be defined by
  * defining the field `level` in the following form:
  *
  *   val level =
  *     """------
  *       |--ST--
  *       |--oo--
  *       |--oo--
  *       |------""".stripMargin
  *
  * - The `-` character denotes parts which are outside the terrain
  * - `o` denotes fields which are part of the terrain
  * - `S` denotes the start position of the block (which is also considered
     inside the terrain)
  * - `T` denotes the final position of the block (which is also considered
     inside the terrain)
  *
  * In this example, the first and last lines could be omitted, and
  * also the columns that consist of `-` characters only.
